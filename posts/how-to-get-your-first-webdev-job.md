In the grand scheme of things, a person can never claim all of their success is entirely their own. We have teachers, peers, and mentors
from all walks of life that we draw our knowledge from. I owe a lot to where I am now in life to the amazing web developer community that
shares educational content freely, whether that be in the form of blog posts or videos. I feel forever indebted to this kind community that
goes out of their way to help others. I write this blog post as a way to pass on the knowledge I gained and in hopes that my first hand account
of going from zero programming skills to full-stack developer helps you on your journey. Shall we begin?

### Where should you start?

I'm going to start off with the assumption that you have no experience writing code at all. There's a few different routes you can take here.

- Go to a traditional school
- Go to a bootcamp
- Become self-taught
- Combine all of the above

I started my journey into tech when I decided that I didn't want to work in sales anymore. I didn't see much room for growth in sales
and I saw year after year how e-commerce companies were beating brick & mortar stores so I decided to embrace change. I didn't know anyone
who was in tech so I did the obvious thing - I enrolled in college. The tl;dr here is that I finished my A.A.S in Computer & Information Systems
and learned strong fundamentals of programming and I.T but in retrospect I feel like that time could have been better spent diving right into
web development and making projects.

You might think going to a bootcamp is a better option then since they're usually between 3 - 6 months in length. The downside is they cost
A LOT and if there's no upfront price, they usually take a cut of your salary when you do get a job. And if for whatever reason you don't
get a developer job, you'll still be paying them back. Unless you've really done your research and are willing to spend a good amount of money
I can't recommend going to a bootcamp. I think if you're willing to teach yourself that there are countless of free ([freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com)) or very cheap ([udemy](https://www.udemy.com)) alternatives.
