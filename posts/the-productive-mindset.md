The internet is filled with articles and apps on how to tweak or hack some aspect of your life to eek that extra bit of value out so I won't be covering any of that today. You might be asking, what could be more important than "hacks" like keeping a checklist, time blocking your day, or minimizing distractions? In my humble experience, nothing is more important than the mindset you approach your work with. Approaching productivity with the wrong mindset can lead to burnout, poor results, and a declining mental state. There are ways to remain productive and live a happy life but first we must answer the question..

## Why Bother Being Productive?

The question almost seems silly, doesn't it? The obvious and easy answers to this question are:

- Get more done
- Have more time
- Make (more) money

The not-so-obvious answers to this question expand on the obvious answers and takes them a layer deeper.
What do I mean by going a layer deeper? An example of this is gravity - we can observe from gravity that "what goes up, must come down" but when we ask a question a deeper like "why does gravity make things go up and go down?" we suddenly realize the complexity behind the system. This hidden complexity is everywhere and especially within us, human beings, the most complex organism to ever exist (that we know of).

Let's take our obvious answers and expand on them to see how much more complex our motives really are:

- Why do you want to get more done?
- Why do you want to have more time?
- Why do you want to make more money?

We can answers these questions using the obvious answers or we can dig deeper. Going the easy route makes it harder to define your purpose and how well defined your purpose is will play a large role in determining how productive you can be and remain over a lifetime.

## Visualize Your Purpose

I can tell you why I want to be productive. I want more time in my life to spend with my loved ones, to gain prestige, to enjoy my hobbies, and to have the freedom to do what I want when I want. All of those reasons can be summed up in a sentence but in my minds eye I can see the faces of my loved ones, I can see the results of my work bringing joy to customers, I can feel my guitar frets underneath my fingers, I can smell the fresh air in the park on a sunny day, and I can hear the sound of the ocean while I'm laying on the beach. Visualizing our purpose brings it to life and anchors us emotionally to it.

There is a fine balance that needs to be struck when hopping on the productivity and goal setting train and that's ensuring we don't become obsessive to our own detriment. You might become unproductive if you focus too much on where you want to be instead of the task at hand. In my opinion, I believe the right balance could be described as "attached non-attachment". Be attached to your motivators for getting things done but at the same time remain non-attached when it's time to hustle.

## Every Battle Is Won Before It Is Ever Fought

Next time, before starting the pomodoro timer or jotting down another task on our checklist, it might be worth something to remind yourself of why you do the things you do.
